Device Description

Interrupt Commands
----

 - **0x0000**: MEM_MAP_SCREEN
	Reads B register and maps a 256 word region of dcpu memory starting at B.  If B = 0 Disconnects the display.  This interrupt also blanks the screen and returns the electron gun to the 0,0 position.


Behaviours
----
The v5000xt will continously loop through its mapped memory section.  Words within this section are interpreted as a pair of 8 bit 2s complement signed numbers in the formate [x][y].If the same point is read twice in a row, the electron beam is disabled until it reaches the next point at which point it is reenabled.  Once the end of the mapped memory section is reached, the screen is blanked and the electron gun reset to [0][0].
The electron gun in the v5000xt is able to traverse 430 degrees per second.  On the standard 15 inch CRT the v5000xt is paired with this equates to 90 inches drawn per second.
