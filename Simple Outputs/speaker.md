This hardware can generate beeps on two separate channels with variable frequency. The amplitude is fixed for both of them with the second channel being slightly quieter.

Interrupt Commands
----

- **0x0000**: SET_FREQUENCY_CHANNEL_1
    - Set frequency of first channel to value read from register B in Hz.

- **0x0001**: SET_FREQUENCY_CHANNEL_2
    - Set frequency of first channel to value read from register B in Hz.

Behaviours
----
If the value in B is 0, that channel is turned off (which is the default state assumed at start-up).
