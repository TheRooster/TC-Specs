Lift Control Module
----

**WARNING**
*Improper use and servicing of lift equipment may cause severe injury,*
*electric shock, or death. To be serviced by licensed lift technicians only.*

#### Overview

The lift control module is an automated system to control passenger elevation
equipment. The LCM is designed as a drop-in control for stand-alone unattended
automated lifts, while also providing features for more advanced external control.

#### Basic operation

The lift control provides an easy to use external interface to allow passengers
to safely control the device. The interface consists of the button control
panel in the lift car, and one or two *call* buttons outside each lift stop
(floor) for up/down as applicable.

Pressing either of the *call* buttons at a lift stop will send a request to
the lift car to travel to that floor.

Pressing a *floor select* button on the interface inside the lift car will
request it travel to the corresponding floor.

When idle, any request will cause the lift to immediately begin travelling to
the requested floor. When the lift reaches any requested floor (or is already
at the requested floor), it will stop; open the access doors; attempt to close
the access doors after a delay; and once closed, either travel to the next
requested floor or return to idle state.

All lift requests are by default processed according to this priority:

1. Any lift stop in the travel path currently internally requested or calling
   in the same travel direction.
2. A first-in first-out (FIFO) queue of floors requested by the internal panel.
3. A first-in first-out (FIFO) queue of external lift stop requests
   (that have not been visited yet).

##### Example
 - Lift is at F1
 - F3 calls lift to go up (3)
 - Lift begins travel (up)
 - Lift stops at F3
 - F7 then F5 requested by internal panel (2)
 - Lift begins travel (up)
 - F4 calls lift to go up (3)
 - F6 calls lift to go down (3)
 - Lift stops at F4 (1)
 - Lift stops at F5 (1)
 - Lift stops at F7 (2)
 - Lift begins travel (down)
 - Lift stops at F6 (3)
 - F2 is requested internally (2)
 - Lift stops at F2 (2)
 - Lift returns to idle.

#### Override Mode

The LCM can be put in *override* mode, using a key or override command.
In this mode, the LCM will ignore/cancel all lift calls and requests, the lift
car may move up and down and stop freely (at points other than lift stops),
and the doors may open and close freely.

**WARNING**
*Having the lift travel with the doors open will void the installation*
*warranty and may cause damage to the lift car, internal/external doors.*
*Improper operation in override mode may cause injury or death.*

#### External Control Mode

For advanced use cases, the LCM can be put in External control mode. While in
this mode requests and calls will not be added to FIFOs unless no command is
received in 30 seconds. If the 30 second timeout is reached the device returns
to the default operation mode.

#### Modes summary

| Mode     | Description                                                    |
| -------: | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default  | Follows Basic Operation semantics                              |
| External | Sends progess/status messages, if times out returns to Default |
| Override | Lift motion unrestricted, inputs ignored, unsafe actions allowed |
| External + Override | Sends/progess status messages, inputs sent messages, but do not trigger timeout. |

Diagnostic Interface
----

The Lift control module features an external signalling interface to provide
advanced control. Commands can be sent over this interface to control the lift,
queue, doors, and a number of other things.
